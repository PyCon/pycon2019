PyCon Web Site Permissions
==========================

Here, collected in one place,
are all of the permissions that need to be granted
for the various conference staff to perform their duties.

Registrant
    When whole groups need to be registered for PyCon,
    the administrator at our registration provider
    visits `/<YEAR>/registration/register/group/`
    and will need this permission to see the form
    and successfully submit it:
    ::

        registration.group_registration
