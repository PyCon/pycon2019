PyCon web site
==============

The PyCon web site is an open-source Django project for the PyCon
conference, based on Pinax Symposion.

It came out of development done by Eldarion for DjangoCon US and US PyCon
but has been independently used for a number of other conferences.

We are in the process of cleaning things up and making them more generic.

The project homepage is http://github.com/caktus/pycon.
