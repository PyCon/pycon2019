PyCon 2014 website being built by Caktus Consulting Group, based on symposion.

Rather than use this as the basis for your conference site directly, you should
instead look at https://github.com/pinax/symposion which was designed for reuse.

PyCon 2014 is built on top of Pinax Symposion but may have customizations that
will just make things more difficult for you.

To run tests
------------

    python manage.py test
